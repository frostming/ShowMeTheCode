US carrier operates in South China Sea

The United States says one of its aircraft carriers has begun operating in South China Sea, where China has been stepping up military activity.

The Defense Department says the USS John C. Stennis arrived in the western Pacific on February 4th, and then began a routine patrol in the South China Sea a few days ago.

It says the carrier is being accompanied by 3 vessels, including 2 cruisers.

The Defense Department says other US vessels were patrolling the area until last week.

Last month, China was found to be building radar systems on reclaimed reefs on the Spratly Islands.

The US government has been calling on China to stop militarizing the South China Sea, and says it will step up efforts to secure freedom of navigation in the area around the artificial islands.

A US Defense Department official says its ships and aircraft operate routinely throughout the Western Pacific.

Some experts see the US deployment of the vessels in the area as a clear signal to China.
