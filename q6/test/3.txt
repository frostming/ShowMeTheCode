Protest against govt. seizure of paper in Turkey

Hundreds of people have taken to the streets in Istanbul to protest a court order to seize Turkey's largest newspaper, which is critical of the government.

More than 500 people rallied on Saturday in front of the headquarters of the Zaman newspaper.

Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the protesters.

On Friday, the court ordered the paper put under government control on suspicion of supporting a Muslim group led by opposition cleric Fethullah Gulen.

The government has designated the group a terrorist organization. Gulen is an influential opponent of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The court order is part of an ongoing crackdown on media critical of the government.

Opposition lawmakers and members of a local journalist association oppose the order, calling it a move against freedom of the press.

US and European Union officials have also expressed concern over the order.
