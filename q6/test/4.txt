Quake-proofing not complete at schools in Japan

Officials at the Japanese education ministry say not all public school buildings will be made earthquake-proof by the end of this fiscal year.

They estimate such work will be completed at about 98 percent of public elementary and junior high schools by the end of this month, when the current fiscal year ends.

They estimate about 2,400 buildings could collapse if they were hit by a powerful earthquake with an intensity of six plus on the Japanese scale of zero to 7.

About a year before the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, nearly three-quarters of all public school buildings had been rebuilt or reinforced to withstand such a quake.

That figure has been rising every year, reaching about 95 percent in 2015.

Officials had hoped the target of 100 percent would be reached as soon as possible during the current fiscal year.

Financial shortages or plans to merge or close some schools have slowed work by some local governments to make schools earthquake-resistant. Ministry officials are urging them to speed that up.
